      <h1>Focus flow with named anchors</h1>
      <p>This page tests the default behavior (from an html perspective) for navigating, via named anchors or "hot links", to sections of content that are, in various ways, "hidden". Before selecting the links below, first tab through the elements on this page and notice the order in which elements receive focus, in particular, notice how the "Focusable Element" link receives focus in a standard fashion just by existing inline with the rest of the page content.</p>
      <p>Then, notice how selecting a link from the navigation changes the focus index which ultimately changes what item receives focus next when tabbing through the interface.</p>

            <h4>This section applies the [hidden] attribute to its container</h4>
            <p>User agent stylesheets hide elements with the "hidden" attribute by default. This has the effect of both hiding them from view as well as hiding those elements from screen readers.</p>

            <h4>This section features the aria-label property</h4>
            <p>With this example, we set the aria-label property on the section element. This has the added benefit of 1) allowing focus to be placed on the "region" in VO, and 2) also causes this section to show up in the landmarks menu.</p>

        <h4>Navigating to a "display: none" element using named anchors</h4>
        <p>In this scenario, we find that because the target element is hidden from view, there is no way for the browser to calculate what the new scroll position should be, so it simply doesn't scroll anywhere, which would otherwise be the default browser behavior.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>tab index is affected, but target element can't receive focus, the result is a weird "dropping the focus on the floor"</li>
          <li>scroll position isn't adjusted as the elements position is unknown</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Navigating to a "hidden" element using named anchors</h4>
        <p>This has a practically identical experience of navigating to a "display none" element. The main thing to notice is that after selecting the link to navigate to the "hidden" section (like a submenu for example), the next press of the tab shifts focus to the next focusable element in the DOM <em>starting</em> at the "hidden" element's position within the source, and <em>not</em> the next focusable element following the link that was selected, which in this case is illustrated by the "*Focusable Element" link.</i></em></p>

        <h4>Navigating to a "aria-hidden" element using named anchors</h4>
        <p>What's interesting here is that even though the target element is hidden from accessibility tooling, it remains in view as most user agent stylesheets do not automatically hide elements just because this property (aria-hidden) is set. As such, any focusable elements that exist within this example container will be next in the tab flow queue.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>target element will receive focus</li>
          <li>tab index is affected</li>
          <li>does scroll to target container</li>
          <li>focusable elements within the target element will come next in the tab index queue</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Takeaways</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>In all cases, when selecting a link that utilizes a named anchor, the underlying tab index is shifted. Focus flow moves to the point in the source where the target element exists. If the target element has focusable children, they will become the next focusable item, otherwise picking up on whatever comes next in the documents source order.</li>
          <li>To control the focus flow from purely an HTML perspective, we must ensure the target element is visible in the sense that it's display property isn't set to "none" and it doesn't feature a "hidden" property.</li>
          <li>Using aria-controls along with named anchors has a default behavior of displaying a "Jump" menu in VO. This information is displays twice for a unknown reason.</li>
          <li>When using VO arrow key navigation, the experience is enrichened quite a bit by simply setting the aria-label attribute on the target element.</li>
